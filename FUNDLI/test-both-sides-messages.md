# Test Both Sides Messages

## Current Situation
- **Admin (hammed)**: Can send messages, all showing as "🔵 OWN" (correct)
- **Lender (usman abdullah)**: Not sending any messages back

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test from Admin Side
1. Login as admin (hammed)
2. Open admin chat with lender
3. Send a message
4. Check console logs for "📤 Sending message:" and "✅ Message sent successfully:"

### Step 2: Test from Lender Side
1. **Login as lender (usman abdullah)**
2. **Go to Messages page** (`http://localhost:5173/chat`)
3. **Click on the admin chat** (with "hammed musa")
4. **Try to send a message** from the lender side
5. **Check console logs** for any errors

### Step 3: Expected Results
After both users send messages, you should see:

**Admin Side:**
- Admin messages: 🔵 OWN (RIGHT side, blue background)
- Lender messages: 🔴 RECEIVED (LEFT side, gray background)

**Lender Side:**
- Admin messages: 🔴 RECEIVED (LEFT side, gray background)  
- Lender messages: 🔵 OWN (RIGHT side, blue background)

## Debug Information
The console will now show:
- `📤 Sending message:` - When trying to send
- `✅ Message sent successfully:` - When message is sent
- `❌ Failed to send message:` - If there's an error

## Common Issues
1. **Lender can't see admin chat** - Check if chat appears in lender's chat list
2. **Lender can't send messages** - Check console for errors
3. **Messages not appearing** - Check Socket.IO connection
4. **All messages on same side** - This is expected if only one user is sending

## Next Steps
1. Test message sending from lender side
2. Check console logs for any errors
3. Verify both users can send and receive messages
4. Confirm message alignment works with messages from both users
