# Message Alignment Debug Guide

## Current Issue
Messages are appearing on the same side despite the alignment logic being correct.

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs
Open browser dev tools (F12) and look for "Message alignment check" logs. You should see:

```javascript
{
  messageIndex: 0,
  senderId: "68c54638e74aca333af95600",
  userId: "68c54638e74aca333af95600", 
  isOwn: true,
  senderName: "hammed",
  currentUserName: "hammed",
  alignment: "RIGHT (own message)",
  messageContent: "ftfyuh...",
  senderUserType: "admin",
  currentUserType: "admin"
}
```

### 2. Expected Behavior
- **Admin messages**: `isOwn: false` → LEFT side (light background)
- **Lender messages**: `isOwn: true` → RIGHT side (blue background)

### 3. Current Problem
From your logs, all messages show `isOwn: true`, which means:
- The admin is seeing their own messages as "own" messages
- This is correct behavior for the admin's perspective
- But you want to see messages from different users on different sides

### 4. The Real Issue
The issue is **perspective**. When you're logged in as admin:
- Your messages appear on the RIGHT (correct)
- Messages from the lender should appear on the LEFT (but they're not)

### 5. Debugging Questions
1. **Are you testing from the admin side or lender side?**
2. **Do you see messages from both admin AND lender in the same chat?**
3. **What does the console show for messages from the lender?**

## Solution Approach

### Option 1: Test from Lender Side
1. Login as the lender (usman abdullah)
2. Open the admin chat
3. Check if admin messages appear on the LEFT
4. Send a message and check if it appears on the RIGHT

### Option 2: Check Message Data
The issue might be that all messages are being sent by the same user. Check:
1. Are messages actually being sent by different users?
2. Is the sender information correct in the database?
3. Are both admin and lender sending messages?

### Option 3: Force Different Alignment
If you want to test the alignment regardless of sender, you can temporarily modify the logic:

```javascript
// Temporary test - alternate messages regardless of sender
const isOwn = index % 2 === 0; // Even indices = own, odd indices = received
```

## Visual Test
Add this temporary code to see if the CSS is working:

```javascript
// In ChatWindow.jsx, replace the isOwn logic temporarily
const isOwn = index % 2 === 0; // Test with alternating messages
```

This will show:
- Messages 0, 2, 4... on the RIGHT (blue)
- Messages 1, 3, 5... on the LEFT (light)

## Expected Console Output
For a proper chat between admin and lender, you should see:

```javascript
// Admin message
{ isOwn: false, senderName: "hammed", currentUserName: "usman", alignment: "LEFT (received message)" }

// Lender message  
{ isOwn: true, senderName: "usman", currentUserName: "usman", alignment: "RIGHT (own message)" }
```

## Next Steps
1. Check which side you're testing from (admin vs lender)
2. Verify that messages are actually being sent by different users
3. Check the console logs for the correct sender information
4. Test the temporary alternating logic to verify CSS is working
