# Simple Loan Repayment System

## Overview
This guide explains the new simplified loan repayment system that directly transfers money from borrower to lender.

## What It Does

### **‚úÖ Simple Process:**
1. **Borrower clicks "Pay Back"** on funded loan
2. **System calculates** total repayment (Principal + Interest)
3. **Checks borrower's wallet** for sufficient funds
4. **Transfers money** from borrower wallet to lender wallet
5. **Updates loan status** to "completed"

### **‚úÖ No Complex Logic:**
- ‚ùå No repayment schedules
- ‚ùå No installment tracking
- ‚ùå No due date calculations
- ‚ùå No late fees
- ‚úÖ Just simple wallet-to-wallet transfer

## How It Works

### **1. Loan Validation:**
```javascript
// Check if loan exists and belongs to borrower
// Check if loan status is 'funded'
// Calculate remaining amount to pay
```

### **2. Wallet Balance Check:**
```javascript
// Get borrower's wallet balance
// Check if sufficient funds available
// Show clear error if insufficient
```

### **3. Money Transfer:**
```javascript
// Subtract amount from borrower wallet
// Add amount to lender wallet
// Update loan status to 'completed'
```

## API Endpoint

### **Route:**
```
POST /api/borrower/repay-loan/:loanId
```

### **Request Body:**
```json
{
  "installmentNumber": null
}
```

```

  "status": "error",
  "message": "Insufficient funds. Required: $63,000.00, Available: $50,000.00"
}

{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Loan not found"
}

// Already repaid
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "This loan has already been fully repaid"
}
```

## Database Updates

### **Borrower Wallet:**
```javascript
// Subtract repayment amount
{ $inc: { balance: -remainingAmount } }
```

### **Lender Wallet:**
```javascript
// Add repayment amount
{ $inc: { balance: remainingAmount } }
```

  $set: { 
    amountRemaining: 0,
    status: 'completed'
  }
}
```

## Test Steps

### **2. Test Insufficient Funds:**

### **3. Test Already Repaid:**
