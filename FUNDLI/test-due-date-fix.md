# Due Date Fix Test Guide

## Overview
This guide tests the fix for the Due Date showing "N/A" in the Repayment Information section.

## Issue Fixed

### **✅ Problem:**
- **Due Date** in Repayment Information section showed "N/A"
- **Repayment Date** in Loan Timeline section showed correctly
- Both should show the same calculated date

### **✅ Solution:**
- Updated Due Date calculation to use the same logic as Repayment Date
- Both now calculate: Funded Date + Duration (months)

## Test Steps

### **1. Check Loan Details Modal**
- Click "View Details" on any funded loan
- Verify both sections show the same date:

#### **Repayment Information Section:**
```
Due Date: December 18, 2025  ← Should show calculated date
```

#### **Loan Timeline Section:**
```
Repayment Date: December 18, 2025  ← Should show same date
```

### **2. Verify Date Calculation**
- Check that both dates are calculated as:
  - **Funded Date**: September 18, 2025
  - **Duration**: 3 months
  - **Due/Repayment Date**: December 18, 2025

### **3. Test Different Scenarios**
- Test with different loan durations:
  - 3 months: Funded Date + 3 months
  - 6 months: Funded Date + 6 months
  - 12 months: Funded Date + 12 months

## Expected Results

### **Before Fix:**
```
Repayment Information:
Due Date: N/A  ← Wrong

Loan Timeline:
Repayment Date: December 18, 2025  ← Correct
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Repayment Information:
Due Date: December 18, 2025  ← Fixed

Loan Timeline:
Repayment Date: December 18, 2025  ← Same date
```

## Code Changes

### **Frontend Fix:**
```javascript
// Before (showing N/A)
Due Date: {selectedLoan.endDate ? new Date(selectedLoan.endDate).toLocaleDateString() : 'N/A'}

// After (calculated date)
Due Date: {(() => {
  if (selectedLoan.fundedAt && selectedLoan.duration) {
    const fundedDate = new Date(selectedLoan.fundedAt);
    const dueDate = new Date(fundedDate);
    dueDate.setMonth(dueDate.getMonth() + selectedLoan.duration);
    return dueDate.toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
      year: 'numeric',
      month: 'long',
      day: 'numeric'
    });
  }
  return 'N/A';
})()}
```

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ Due Date in Repayment Information shows calculated date
- ✅ Repayment Date in Loan Timeline shows same date
- ✅ Both dates use Funded Date + Duration calculation
- ✅ Date formatting is consistent (Month Day, Year)
- ✅ Days remaining calculation works correctly
- ✅ Pay Back and Auto Repay functions use correct due date

## Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: 3-Month Loan**
- Funded Date: September 18, 2025
- Duration: 3 months
- Due/Repayment Date: December 18, 2025

### **Scenario 2: 6-Month Loan**
- Funded Date: October 1, 2025
- Duration: 6 months

### **Scenario 3: 12-Month Loan**
- Funded Date: January 15, 2025
- Duration: 12 months
- Due/Repayment Date: January 15, 2026

## Notes

- Both use the same calculation: Funded Date + Duration
- Date formatting is consistent across both sections
- Days remaining calculation works with the correct due date
- Pay Back and Auto Repay functions use the correct due date
