# Field Name Fix Test Guide

## Overview
This guide tests the fix for field name mismatches in the loan repayment route.

## Problem Identified
- **Issue**: Route was using `borrowerId` and `lenderId` fields that don't exist in Loan model
- **Root Cause**: Loan model uses `borrower` field, not `borrowerId`
- **Secondary Issue**: No `lenderId` field, lender is accessed through `lendingPool.creator`

## Changes Made

### **✅ Loan Population Fix:**
- **Before**: `.populate('borrowerId', 'email firstName lastName walletBalance')`
- **After**: `.populate('borrower', 'email firstName lastName walletBalance')`

### **✅ Borrower Ownership Check Fix:**
- **Before**: `loan.borrowerId._id.toString() !== req.user.id`
- **After**: `loan.borrower._id.toString() !== req.user.id`

### **✅ Wallet Balance Check Fix:**
- **Before**: `const borrower = await User.findById(loan.borrowerId._id || loan.borrowerId)`
- **After**: `const borrower = loan.borrower`

### **✅ Lender Access Fix:**
- **Before**: `loan.lenderId._id || loan.lenderId`
- **After**: `loan.lendingPool?.creator`

## Test Steps

### **1. Test Loan Population**
- Verify loan is found and populated correctly
- Check borrower information is available
- Confirm lendingPool is populated

### **2. Test Borrower Ownership**
- Verify borrower ownership check works
- Test with correct borrower ID
- Test with incorrect borrower ID

### **3. Test Wallet Balance Check**
- Verify borrower wallet balance is accessible
- Test with sufficient balance
- Test with insufficient balance

### **4. Test Lender Access**
- Verify lender is found through lendingPool.creator
- Test lender wallet update
- Check lender information in response

## Expected Results

### **Before Fix:**
```
Payment Error
Payment failed: Failed to process loan repayment
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Payment Successful!
Loan repayment processed successfully
```

## Database Field Mapping

### **Loan Model Fields:**
```javascript
{
  borrower: ObjectId,        // ✅ Correct field name
  lendingPool: ObjectId,     // ✅ Contains lender reference
  // borrowerId: undefined,   // ❌ Doesn't exist
  // lenderId: undefined     // ❌ Doesn't exist
}
```

### **LendingPool Model Fields:**
```javascript
{
  creator: ObjectId,         // ✅ This is the lender
  name: String,
  description: String,
  poolSize: Number
}
```

## API Response Structure

### **Success Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Loan repayment processed successfully",
  "data": {
    "amount": 63000,
    "lateFee": 0,
    "installmentNumber": 1,
    "paymentId": "virtual-repayment",
    "lender": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```
