# Flat Interest Rate System Test Guide

## Overview
This guide tests the updated borrower dashboard with the correct flat interest rate system implementation.

## Flat Interest Rate System Explanation

### **How It Works:**
- **Interest is calculated ONCE** for the entire loan period
- **Example**: $60,000 loan for 3 months at 5% interest
  - Principal: $60,000
  - Interest: $60,000 × 5% = $3,000
  - Total Repayment: $60,000 + $3,000 = $63,000
  - Due at the end of 3 months (not monthly payments)

### **Key Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Removed "Monthly Payment" references
2. ✅ Added "Interest Amount" calculation
3. ✅ Updated "Total Repayment" calculation (Principal + Interest)
4. ✅ Proper date formatting and due date calculation
5. ✅ Updated Pay Back and Auto Repay functions

- **Interest Rate**: 8% (Flat Rate)
- **Interest Amount**: $8,000
- **Total Repayment**: $108,000
- **Duration**: 6 months
- **Due Date**: Funded Date + 6 months
