# 404 Error Debug Guide

## Overview
This guide helps debug the 404 error when accessing the PayBackPage.

## Investigation Results

### **✅ Frontend Route Configuration:**
- **Route**: `/payback/:loanId` ✅
- **Component**: PayBackPage ✅
- **Import**: Correct ✅
- **Build**: Successful ✅

### **✅ Backend API Route:**
- **Route**: `GET /api/loans/:loanId` ✅
- **Controller**: `getLoanById` ✅
- **Protection**: `protect` middleware ✅

## Possible Causes

### **1. Loan ID Doesn't Exist:**
- The loan ID `68ce2e505180ea8932507e64` might not exist in the database
- The loan might have been deleted or never created

### **2. Access Permission Issue:**
- The user might not have access to this specific loan
- The loan might belong to a different borrower

### **3. Backend Server Issue:**
- The backend server might not be running
- The API endpoint might be down

## Debug Steps

### **1. Check Console Logs:**
When you access `/payback/68ce2e505180ea8932507e64`, check the browser console for:

```
🔍 PayBackPage loaded with loanId: 68ce2e505180ea8932507e64
🔍 Location state: { loan: {...} }
🔍 Fetching loan data for loanId: 68ce2e505180ea8932507e64
🔍 API URL: http://localhost:5000/api/loans/68ce2e505180ea8932507e64
🔍 Loan API response status: 404
❌ Loan API error: 404 Not Found
```

### **2. Check Network Tab:**
- Open browser DevTools → Network tab
- Look for the failed request to `/api/loans/68ce2e505180ea8932507e64`
- Check the response status and error message

### **3. Test API Directly:**
You can test the API directly by making a request to:
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/loans/68ce2e505180ea8932507e64
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Solutions

### **Solution 1: Use Loan Data from Navigation State**
If the loan data is passed via navigation state, the PayBackPage should use that data instead of fetching from API:

```javascript
// In PayBackPage useEffect
if (location.state?.loan) {
  setLoan(location.state.loan);
  setIsLoading(false);
  // Calculate repayment amount from passed loan data
} else {
  // Only fetch from API if no loan data passed
  fetchLoanData();
}
```

### **Solution 2: Verify Loan Exists**
Check if the loan exists in the database:
- Go to borrower dashboard
- Check if the loan appears in "Upcoming Payments"
- Verify the loan ID matches

### **Solution 3: Check User Permissions**
Ensure the user has access to the loan:
- The loan must belong to the current borrower
- The user must be authenticated
- The loan must exist in the database

## Expected Console Output

### **Successful Load:**
```
🔍 PayBackPage loaded with loanId: 68ce2e505180ea8932507e64
🔍 Location state: { loan: {...} }
🔍 Fetching loan data for loanId: 68ce2e505180ea8932507e64
🔍 API URL: http://localhost:5000/api/loans/68ce2e505180ea8932507e64
🔍 Loan API response status: 200
🔍 Loan API response data: { status: "success", data: { loan: {...} } }
```

### **404 Error:**
```
🔍 PayBackPage loaded with loanId: 68ce2e505180ea8932507e64
🔍 Location state: { loan: {...} }
🔍 Fetching loan data for loanId: 68ce2e505180ea8932507e64
🔍 API URL: http://localhost:5000/api/loans/68ce2e505180ea8932507e64
🔍 Loan API response status: 404
❌ Loan API error: 404 Not Found
❌ Loan API error data: { status: "error", message: "Loan not found" }
```

## Next Steps

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for the debug output when accessing the page
2. **Verify Loan Data**: Ensure the loan exists and user has access
3. **Test API Directly**: Make a direct API call to verify the endpoint
4. **Check Backend Logs**: Look for any errors in the backend server logs

## Notes
- The frontend route is correctly configured
- The backend API route exists and is properly protected
- The 404 error is likely from the API call, not the frontend route
- Debug logs have been added to help identify the exact issue
