# Loan Data Fix Test Guide

## Overview
This guide tests the fix for missing interest rate and funded date data in the borrower dashboard.

## Issues Fixed

### **✅ Backend Fix (FUNDLI-Backend/src/routes/loans.js)**
- **Added**: `interestRate` field to recentLoans mapping
- **Added**: `fundedAt` field to recentLoans mapping  
- **Added**: `duration` field to recentLoans mapping
- **Added**: `totalRepayment` calculation to recentLoans mapping

### **✅ Frontend Fix (FUNDLI/src/pages/dashboard/BorrowerDashboard.jsx)**
- **Added**: Fallback values for missing interest rate (`|| 0`)
- **Added**: Fallback values for missing duration (`|| 0`)
- **Updated**: Flat rate explanation to handle missing data
- **Updated**: All calculations to handle missing data gracefully

## Test Steps

### **1. Check Backend Data**
- Verify the borrower stats endpoint now includes:
  - `interestRate`: Loan's interest rate
  - `fundedAt`: Date when loan was funded
  - `duration`: Loan duration in months
  - `totalRepayment`: Calculated total repayment

### **2. Test Upcoming Payments Section**
- Check that funded loans now show:
  - ✅ **Interest Rate**: Shows actual rate (e.g., "5% (Flat Rate)")
  - ✅ **Interest Amount**: Shows calculated interest
  - ✅ **Total Repayment**: Shows principal + interest
  - ✅ **Due Date**: Shows calculated due date

### **3. Test Loan Details Modal**
- Click "View Details" on any funded loan
- Verify modal shows:
  - ✅ **Interest Rate**: Shows actual rate with "(Flat Rate)" label
  - ✅ **Interest Amount**: Shows calculated interest in orange
  - ✅ **Total Repayment**: Shows principal + interest
  - ✅ **Funded Date**: Shows actual funded date
  - ✅ **Repayment Date**: Shows calculated repayment date
  - ✅ **Days Remaining**: Shows countdown to repayment

### **4. Test Calculations**
- Verify all calculations work correctly:
  - Interest Amount = Principal × Interest Rate ÷ 100
  - Total Repayment = Principal + Interest Amount
  - Repayment Date = Funded Date + Duration (months)

## Expected Results

### **Before Fix:**
```
Interest Rate: % (Flat Rate)  ← Missing rate
Interest Amount: $0          ← Wrong calculation
Total Repayment: $60,000     ← Missing interest
Funded Date: Not Funded Yet  ← Missing date
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Interest Rate: 5% (Flat Rate)     ← Shows actual rate
Interest Amount: $3,000           ← Correct calculation
Total Repayment: $63,000         ← Principal + Interest
Funded Date: September 25, 2025  ← Shows actual date
Repayment Date: December 25, 2025 ← Calculated date
```

## Data Flow

### **Backend (loans.js):**
```javascript
const recentLoans = loans.slice(0, 5).map(loan => ({
  _id: loan._id,
  loanAmount: loan.loanAmount,
  purpose: loan.purpose,
  status: loan.status,
  amountPaid: loan.amountPaid || 0,
  nextPaymentDate: loan.nextPaymentDate,
  createdAt: loan.createdAt,
  interestRate: loan.interestRate || 0,        // ← Added
  fundedAt: loan.fundedAt,                     // ← Added
  duration: loan.duration,                     // ← Added
  totalRepayment: loan.totalRepayment || (loan.loanAmount + (loan.loanAmount * (loan.interestRate || 0) / 100))  // ← Added
}));
```

### **Frontend (BorrowerDashboard.jsx):**
```javascript
// Upcoming Payments
Interest Rate: {loan.interestRate || 0}% (Flat Rate)
Interest Amount: ${((loan.loanAmount || 0) * (loan.interestRate || 0) / 100).toLocaleString()}
Total Repayment: ${((loan.loanAmount || 0) + ((loan.loanAmount || 0) * (loan.interestRate || 0) / 100)).toLocaleString()}

// Loan Details Modal
Interest Rate: {selectedLoan.interestRate || 0}% (Flat Rate)
Funded Date: {selectedLoan.fundedAt ? new Date(selectedLoan.fundedAt).toLocaleDateString(...) : 'Not Funded Yet'}
Repayment Date: {calculated from fundedAt + duration}
```

## Test Scenarios

- **Principal**: $60,000
- **Interest Rate**: 5%
- **Interest Amount**: $3,000
- **Total Repayment**: $63,000
- **Funded Date**: September 25, 2025
- **Repayment Date**: December 25, 2025

### **Scenario 2: $100,000 Loan, 6 Months, 8% Interest**
- **Principal**: $100,000
